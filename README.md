# One

When one `video` and one `canvas` element is on the page, and you request fullscreen on the `canvas` element on iOS, it will fullscreen the `video` element.

# Two

When two of each is on the page, then fullscreen works for no element on iOS.

# Notes

Fullscreen canvas will have a green border to distinguish it from the video.

Tested on simulator with `iPhone XR - 12.4`.
