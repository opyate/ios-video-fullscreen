# Intro

Like 0003, but trying some iOS-specific changes.

# Conclusion

Using an iDevice on browserstack maximises the video element, not the canvas as requested in the Javascript.

I suggest getting a cheap iDevice on eBay so I can debug this in more depth, as browserstack limits sessions to 30 seconds, after which you can't use a specific device again.
